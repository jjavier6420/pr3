	  <h1> My Baseball Carrer</h1>
	  <p><img src="../Cooperstown.jpg" width="259" height="194" alt=""><span style="font-size: 56px; font-family: lakeside, sans-serif;">I started playing baseball when I was5 years old.</span> I have been playing from then till now which has been a total of 11 years. I started off playing tee ball and worked my way up to being able to play around the country. The best experiance I had was when I went to a place called Cooperstown, NY. I got to experiance a fun time with my teamates and my family as well as hit my first home run.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

	  <h1> New York Yankees</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/yankee_stadium.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="194" class="floatleft"><span style="font-family: lakeside, sans-serif; font-size: 36pt;">The New York Yankees</span> <span style="font-size: 16pt">have been my favorite baseball team since I was born. Both my parents were raised in New york so in a way I was born into loving the team. Over the years the Yankees have won a lot of championships but have not won one recently. This year they yankees are looking promising as they pick up a couple of power house players with the main one being Corey Kluber. Kluber had a great year in 2018 when he was with the Indians but didn't really start much in the last 2 years. Kluber decided to make a change and signed an 11 million dollar 1 year contract with the Yankees.</span></p>
